/*
 * charbench.c — char-heavy benchmark for compiler comparison.
 *
 * Mirrors intbench's structure but on 8-bit data. Two passes, one
 * per signedness:
 *
 *   1. crc8_ccitt (unsigned char) — bit-by-bit CRC-8-CCITT (poly 0x07,
 *      init 0xFF) repeated REPS times over the same 1 KB buffer.
 *      Real-world checksum used in I2C, OneWire, ATM cell headers,
 *      Bluetooth HCI. Pure inner-loop unsigned-byte arithmetic: ^=,
 *      &, <<, conditional XOR with polynomial. Stresses the walker's
 *      unsigned-char compare-with-const fastpath, char shift, and
 *      char widen-when-needed paths.
 *
 *   2. schar_mix (signed char) — sign-conditional accumulator mix
 *      over the buffer reinterpreted as signed bytes. Exercises
 *      signed-char compare-with-const, sign-extension on load, and
 *      signed += / -= on a char accumulator.
 *
 * Same deterministic 1 KB seed as intbench, so cross-bench cache
 * behaviour and frame layout are comparable. Expected results
 * computed by a host program (see expected.txt).
