# zwin

zwin is a GUI for the yos operating system. 

## Architecture 

zwin rests on top of the yos operating system and the gpx library of 
graphics primitives. 

the yos operating system provides basic services such as memory management, 
drivers (for keyboard and mouse!), and threading, while the gpx provides 
drawing functions.
